### Quotes

- > We don't need wealth, we need happiness, and we want our children to have a good life.<br><br>
  We got this so backwards, just profoundly backwards.<br><br>
  Everybody knows that the key to happiness is not more stuff. Everybody knows that.<br><br>
  And yet, what are we busy doing? Trying to get more and more stuff. Which keeps the rich to 
  the rich getting richer.<br><br>
  We have to wake up at some point.<br><br> 
  We're really really confused.

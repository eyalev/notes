## Current Issues

### Ineffective Use of Resources

This is a dominant theme in our current political systems. Money and resources are not being
allocated effectively. Wrong incentives, bad metrics, waste, and corruption are prevalent. 

## Possible Courses of Action

### Evolution of Communities

A way to develop better ways to use our resources and the planet's resources.

- Allow to easily create new communities
  - They can be 
    - Global or local
    - Founded around different interests
- These communities will experiment with new ways of allocating and using money and resources
  while having core values that will benefit our society and planet for the long run.
- As time goes by, new structures, systems, and collaborating practices will emerge.
- Sharing between communities, similar to open-source.

## Available Versions

The cluster versions available in GKE are not the newest Kubernetes versions that have been
released.

The new versions are available as 
[Alpha Clusters](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/alpha-clusters) 
and after some time become available for general use.

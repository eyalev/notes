- [Knowledge-repos](https://github.com/git-wiki/wiki/blob/master/pages/knowledge_repos.md) 
  could become a database for a new social network.
  - Multiple content types:
    - Status updates
    - Blog posts
    - Knowledge articles (wiki-like)
    - Thoughts
    - Principles
    - Mental Models
    - Mindsets
  - The data could be owned by the users 
  - Multiple licenses could be used
